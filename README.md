# BruEnroll
## Enrollment statistics for UCLA
This is a tool I developed to scrape the [UCLA registrar
pages](http://www.registrar.ucla.edu) for class
enrollment, among other public data on those pages. This project is a rewrite of
the project found [here](https://github.com/anjuwong/clsc), formatted a bit more
nicely, using MongoDB instead of MySQL, and with a front-end written with Python
instead of PHP.
